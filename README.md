# Crypto Predictive Model 🚀💡

A predictive modeling project to analyze and forecast cryptocurrency trends by leveraging machine learning techniques and data insights. 📊📈

---

## Workflow 🛠️✨

1. Preprocessed a massive dataset of **10 million tweets** 🐦, summarizing them using **Sumy** for better insights 🔍.
2. Extracted important tokens (nouns, adverbs, verbs, etc.) using **NLTK** 🧠 to deeply understand tweet content 📋.
3. Performed sentiment analysis on tweets using **Ollama LLaMA 3B** 💬😄📉.
4. Integrated and analyzed **Bitcoin 2022 data** 💰, correlating it with tweets and preparing it for predictive modeling 📊.
5. Built a predictive model using **Scikit-learn's RandomForestRegressor** 🤖🌟 to forecast cryptocurrency trends.
